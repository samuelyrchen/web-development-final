Introduction: The core of the final assignment I choose is constructing a 
website for magazine calls "New Times". The basic components for this 
website is contributed from a home page, which the majority of the body 
part would introduce some hot topic, story or hot sales to the client. 
Three pages linked to navigation bar on home page (exclude the home menu), 
the subscription page, the wish list page and the academy page. The 
subscription page introduce the magazine subscribed by client, the wish 
list page is designed for placing client's order which is not paid for 
subscription, and the academy page introduce the current magazine available 
on website. Aside from home page and three navigation pages, there is 
another page for 'Sign Up' button which direct client to another page 
called registration page. Clients can fill the form and submit it so they 
can register an account on website.

Inspiration: One reason inspired me to construct a magazine website instead 
of newsletter is, I prefer reading magazine more than newsletter since 
content in magazine is more intresting than newsletter. The second reason 
is in my opinion, the design of magazine is more extensible since there are 
lots of category of magazines that contain various of topics and news 
available to design. The final reason, which is the most important one, I am 
more familiar with magazine that I can easily came up with a clear thought 
to design the website.

Accessibility: One thing that is accessible is the font size on the page is 
adjustable, three types of font size (small, medium and large) are available 
for client to take control. The second function that is accessible is the 
position of each element in web pages are well-organised and looks neatly on 
different screen sizes. Which means by that every content on page is well-
display whether client use mobile, tablet or PC to access the pages. One 
last thing that is accessible, in concern of some browsers may not support 
some documents that would reduce the errors clients would encounter, some 
unneccessary external codes or file is never used on this assignment.

Usability: First, the organisation of each page is clear and straightforword 
that clients can easily spot what they want to look for. Second, a sorting 
function is implied to sort the category of magazine that clients can easily 
find what they want. The last, interactive elements on page such as buttons 
are hightlighted, or the styling of the elements changes once hover on them, 
these would give client more impression on what they currently spot.

Learning: I learned that in this project, library such as handlebars.js is 
quite important when dealing with massive files from clients. Html, css and 
javascript are bond together to generate nowadays website that is well-
organised, having various of styling, and having interative capability to 
clients. Despite this, library is much more important if want to develop 
more advanced function to websites. It is very neccessary to keep files like 
css stylesheets, script files and their content clean, organised and 
straightforword for further development of website since it makes difficulty 
to find the code I want.

Evaluation I: The most successful progress for me in this assignment I think 
is well distinguish the screen size and their screen view. Which is quite 
essential for client to access the full content of my pages.

Evaluation II: The aspect I need to improve is the manipulation of advanced 
javascript library. For instance, I am still not familiar with such library 
like handlebars.js that it is quite hard for me to use it refer complicated 
content from external files.

Resources: Some of the solution of my codes are refer to other developer's 
sokution on Stack Overflow. The library I use in this assignment is 
handlebars.js from 'https://cdnjs.com/libraries/handlebars.js'. Another tool 
I frequently use is the GitHub, which is quite helpful to store each version 
of my assignment and give commit and draw back on each update of the version 
for each upload. Also, GitHub also provide github-pages that allows my to 
host the website for free.
